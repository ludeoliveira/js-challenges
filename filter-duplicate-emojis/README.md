# Filter Duplicate Emojis

For this challenge I had to write the JavaScript code to filter out all duplicate given emojis and render on the DOM only one of each emoji.

## Stretch goals:

• Add the option to render all the emojis, sorted by emoji type;

• in addition, I have coded a clear button, that cleans up the textfield with the filtered or sorted emojis.
