# Gift Selector

For this challenge I had to write the JavaScript code to add this functionality: display the total price in the DOM accordind to the options selected in the form.

## Stretch goals:

• display an error message if the user doesnt't fill in all the options;

• Add a custom checkbox for the ballon option.
